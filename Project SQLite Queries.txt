What was done for this project in SQLite: 
(including queries executed)

#1.	Create database in SQLite
#2.	Import CSV file 

#3.	Clean table by removing column “PERSONS”
ALTER TABLE vaccine DROP COLUMN PERSONS

#4.	Pull column with another name. 
SELECT TOTAL_VACCINATIONS AS VAC FROM VACCINE

#5.	Answered question how many vaccinations on average happened in each country per one vaccine type used in that country
SELECT TOTAL_VACCINATIONS/NUMBER_VACCINES_TYPES_USED AS AVERAGEVAC FROM Vaccine

#6.	Add column from (5.) above to our table 
UPDATE vaccine 
SET AVERAGEVAC = TOTAL_VACCINATIONS/NUMBER_VACCINES_TYPES_USED
SELECT * FROM VACCINE

#7.	Find maximum and average
select max(TOTAL_VACCINATIONS), COUNTRY from Vaccine
select avg(DEATHS) from Vaccine

#8.	Delete rows under “DEATHS” column that has value NULL and N/As 
#9.	Select “TOTAL_VACCINATIONS” group and order it 
DELETE FROM Vaccine
WHERE DEATHS LIKE '%N/A' OR NULL
select TOTAL_VACCINATIONS, NUMBER_VACCINES_TYPES_USED, DEATHS from Vaccine GROUP BY NUMBER_VACCINES_TYPES_USED ORDER BY DEATHS DESC

#10 Rename column completely in the table
ALTER TABLE vaccine 
RENAME COLUMN TOTAL_VACCINATIONS TO TVAC
